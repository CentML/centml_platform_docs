We provide a Python SDK to programmatically access CentML Platform backend APIs to manage your deployments.

Following is a sample code to list all the inference deployments under your account.

```python
import centml
from centml.sdk.api import get_centml_client
from centml.sdk import DeploymentType

with get_centml_client() as cclient:
    deployments = cclient.get(DeploymentType.INFERENCE_V2)
    print(deployments)
```

For more examples, please refer to https://github.com/CentML/centml-python-client/blob/main/examples/sdk/
