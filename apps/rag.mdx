Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages external knowledge sources to enhance the accuracy and relevance of text generated by large language models. By incorporating real-world information, RAG empowers LLMs to produce more comprehensive and informative outputs.

## 1. Configure your RAG application

Name your RAG application and select the embedding and language models from the drop down list.

</Frame>

Click next.


## 2. Select the cluster and the hardware to deploy

Select the cluster and hardware instance where you want to deploy the embedding model.

<Tip>
Embedding models are typically small and can be efficiently run on lower-end GPUs like A10G and L4s, making this a more cost-effective hardware option.
</Tip>

Click deploy.


## 3. Use the RAG deployment

Once the deployment is ready, go to the Playground tab under deployment details page.
