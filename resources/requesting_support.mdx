Support for invoices, payment methods, and usage details.

**Add a New Cluster**  
Requests for adding a new region or zone for your workloads.

**Request a Serverless Model**  
Requests for a specific model available via serverless.

**Other**  
Any requests that don't fit the above catagory. Send it here and we will route it to the appropriate team.

Refer to the chart below to help determine the best priority level.
For `Urgent` or `High` requests, we recommend emailing `support@centml.ai` and contacting your dedicated sales representative for faster assistance. 

| Urgency | Impact       | Description                                      | Example                                | Response Expectation                                 |

| Urgent  | Critical     | Broad impact across systems or users             | Complete service outage                | Immediate action; highest priority                   |
| High    | Significant  | Major functionality broken or severely limited   | Core feature failure                   | Fast response; prioritized within regular work hours |
| Medium  | Moderate     | Noticeable disruption, but workarounds exist     | Minor feature behaving unexpectedly    | Addressed in order of priority                       |
| Low     | Minimal      | Minor inconvenience or cosmetic issue            | Typo or UI glitch                      | Added to backlog for future review                   |


### 4. Fill Out the Support Request Form
