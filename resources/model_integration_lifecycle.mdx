The Model Integration Lifecycle (MILC) can be viewed as a practical extension—or counterpart—to the Model Infrastructure Lifecycle. Its purpose is to define common terminology and provide a structured framework for teams adopting large language models (LLMs) and managing their transition into and out of production environments.

MILC aligns closely with the [Model Development Lifecycle (MDLC)](https://www.frgrisk.com/the-model-development-lifecycle-mdlc-building-and-testing-the-model/), while also embracing DevOps and MLOps principles of continuous improvement and evaluation.

| Phase                         | Purpose                                                   | Example                                                                                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requirements Gathering       | Identify business needs and model fit                    | Need a model to summarize tickets in less than 3s with PII redaction                                  |
| Feasibility Analysis         | Evaluate performance, latency, cost, infra readiness     | LLaMA 2-70B meets quality targets; latency less than 1s possible via serverless CentML endpoint       |
| Design & Architecture        | Plan API integration, security, auth, observability      | Use CentML’s `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint (OpenAI-compatible); authenticate using API tokens; log request/response metadata to BigQuery |
| Development & Integration    | Build prompt templates, format inputs/outputs, handle tokens, retries | Build API route to send prompt to CentML endpoint and return structured response |
| Fine-tuning (optional)       | Improve model behavior on domain-specific tasks          | Fine-tune LLaMA 2 on internal support ticket dataset                                         |
| Testing & Validation         | Run unit, functional, latency, and accuracy tests        | Compare LLM summaries to human-written ones; use ROUGE/LFQA scoring                          |
| A/B Testing or Canary Deploy | Gradually release the model to validate behavior and avoid regressions | Route 10% of support queries to new model or prompt version, measure impact       |
| Deployment                   | Roll out model integration in production                 | Deploy autoscaled API backend with load-balanced access to CentML endpoint                  |
| Monitoring & Optimization    | Track usage, quality, token cost, drift                  | Monitor latency, output quality; alert on spike in cost per token                            |
| Model Retirement / Replacement | Retire underperforming models or roll in upgraded versions | Decommission v1 endpoint after v2 adoption; archive prompts and logs for compliance         |


## Where Does CentML Fit In?
CentML can support teams during multiple phases of the Model Integration Lifecycle. See below for details

### Model Integration Life Cycle Phases and How CentML Supports Them
1. **Requirements Gathering:**	Teams can evaluate CentML’s API features (e.g., latency, scalability, cost models) as well as model quality to inform LLM feasibility.
2. **Feasibility Analysis:**	CentML allows instant access to high-performance LLM endpoints, enabling latency, throughput, and cost testing early on.
3. **Design & Architecture:**	CentML exposes standardized /v1/chat/completions endpoints with token-based auth, simplifying architecture planning.
4. **Development & Integration:**	Developers integrate CentML endpoints using standard OpenAI SDKs or HTTP clients like httpx, minimizing boilerplate.
5. **Fine-tuning (optional iteration step):**	While CentML currently focuses on serving, [Custom Model Endpoints](apps/inference) and [LLM serving](apps/llm) support serving fine-tuned models.
6. **Testing & Validation:**	Teams can test prompt formats and model behavior in CentML’s hosted environment with minimal infrastructure overhead.
7. **A/B Testing or Canary:** Deploy	CentML's flexibility allows parallel deployments. Users must implement endpoint routing logic for A/B or canary testing via external tooling.
8. **Deployment:**	CentML handles scalable, production-ready deployment — no need to manage GPU infra or custom serving stacks.
9. **Monitoring & Optimization:**	Users can track token usage, latency, and costs through CentML’s reporting, and tune prompt performance accordingly.
10. **Model Retirement / Replacement:**	Teams can switch CentML endpoints to newer models they've evauluated with CentMLs serverless endpoints or deploy multiple endpoints with different model versions without re-architecting infrastructure.
