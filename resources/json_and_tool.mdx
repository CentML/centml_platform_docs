Both **Serverless** and **Dedicated** LLM APIs from CentML support structured outputs using the same OpenAI-compatible API. These features are crucial for agentic workloads that require reliable data parsing and function calling. The CentML platform also provides reasoning-enabled models (e.g., `DeepSeek-AI/deepseek-r1`) that can perform reasoning before generating structured outputs.

## JSON Schema Output

When you need a response strictly formatted as JSON, you can use JSON schema constraints. This is particularly useful in scenarios where your system or other downstream processes rely on valid JSON.

Below is an example of how to set up a request to the CentML LLM API using JSON schema enforcement. 

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Retrieve the model name from environment variables
model = os.environ.get("MODEL", "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1")

# Supply your API key from https://app.centml.com/user/vault
api_key = os.environ.get("CENTML_API_KEY")
assert api_key is not None, "Please provide an API Key"


# Define the prompt for the OpenAI compatible API
prompt = [
    {
        "content": (
            "You are a helpful assistant that answers in JSON. Here's the json schema you must adhere to:\n"
            "<schema>\n"
            "{'title': 'WirelessAccessPoint', 'type': 'object', 'properties': {'ssid': {'title': 'SSID', 'type': 'string'}, "
            "'securityProtocol': {'title': 'SecurityProtocol', 'type': 'string'}, 'bandwidth': {'title': 'Bandwidth', 'type': 'string'}}, "
            "'required': ['ssid', 'securityProtocol', 'bandwidth']}\n"
            "</schema>\n"
        ),
        "role": "system"
    },
    {
        "content": (
            "The access point's SSID should be 'OfficeNetSecure', it uses WPA2-Enterprise as its security protocol, "
            "and it's capable of a bandwidth of up to 1300 Mbps on the 5 GHz band. This JSON object will be used to document our network "
            "configurations and to automate the setup process for additional access points in the future. Please provide a JSON object that "
            "includes these details."
        ),
        "role": "user"
    }
]

# Define the JSON schema for the wireless access point configuration
schema_json = {
    "title": "WirelessAccessPoint",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "ssid": {"title": "SSID", "type": "string"},
        "securityProtocol": {"title": "SecurityProtocol", "type": "string"},
        "bandwidth": {"title": "Bandwidth", "type": "integer"}
    },
    "required": ["ssid", "securityProtocol", "bandwidth"]
}

# Initialize the OpenAI compatible CentML client with the API key and base URL
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=api_key,
    base_url="https://api.centml.com/openai/v1",
)

# Create a chat completion request with the defined prompt and schema
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=prompt,
    max_tokens=5000,
    temperature=0,
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {"name": "schema", "schema": schema_json}
    }
)

# Print the entire chat completion response
print("Chat Completion Response:", chat_completion)

# Print the content of the first choice in the chat completion response
print("Generated JSON Object:", chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### How it Works

1. **Prompt Construction**: Provide a system message telling the model to respond in JSON, along with the JSON schema itself.
2. **Schema Enforcement**: In the `response_format` parameter, specify `"type": "json_schema"` and include your JSON schema definition.
3. **Parsing the Output**: The response is guaranteed to follow the schema (as strictly as the model can enforce it). You can then parse it directly in your application.

## Tool (Function) Calling

CentML’s LLM APIs support function calling similarly to OpenAI’s “function calling” feature. This allows you to define “tools” that the model can call with structured parameters. For example, you might have a `get_weather` function your model can invoke based on user requests.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Retrieve the model name from environment variables
model = os.environ.get("MODEL", "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct")

# Supply your API key from https://app.centml.com/user/vault
api_key = os.environ.get("CENTML_API_KEY")
assert api_key is not None, "Please provide an API Key"

# Initialize the OpenAI compatible CentML client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=api_key,
    base_url="https://api.centml.com/openai/v1",
)

# Define a tool (function) the model can call
tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
                }
            },
            "required": ["location"],
            "additionalProperties": False
        },
        "strict": True
    }
}]

# Create the chat completion with tool definitions
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"}],
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="auto"
)

# Print any tool calls the model attempts
print("Tool Calls:", completion.choices[0].message.tool_calls)
```

### How it Works

1. **Tool Definition**: In the `tools` parameter, define a function with a `name`, `description`, and a JSON schema for parameters.
2. **Function Invocation**: The model may decide to call the function (tool), returning the parameters it deems relevant based on user input.
3. **Your Application Logic**: You receive the structured function arguments in `completion.choices[0].message.tool_calls`. You can then handle them programmatically (e.g., call an actual weather service).

<Note>
**Tip**: Make sure your model (e.g., `gpt-4o` or `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1`) is function-call capable. Not all model versions support function calling. Always check the CentML model documentation for compatibility.
</Note>

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Schema Validation**: The model will try to adhere to your schema, but always perform server-side validation before using the data (especially important in production).
- **Temperature Setting**: When generating structured data, lower the temperature to reduce the likelihood of extraneous or incorrect fields.
- **Use Reasoning Models**: For complex tasks requiring reasoning steps, consider using `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1`. It provides chain-of-thought style reasoning capabilities.
- **Production Hardening**: If you’re building an agentic or workflow-driven application, ensure you handle potential parsing errors and fallback scenarios gracefully.

<Note>
Both Serverless and Dedicated LLM APIs share the same interface and usage pattern. You only need to change the **base URL** (and any relevant credentials) if you switch between them.
</Note>

## Conclusion

Using JSON schema enforcement and function calling (tools) with CentML LLM APIs lets you build more reliable, agentic, and automated workflows. With minimal changes to your existing OpenAI-compatible code, you can take advantage of these features on the CentML platform—whether you’re deploying on **Serverless** or **Dedicated**.
