The CentML Platform operates on a credit-based billing system, where 1 CentML credit equals 1 USD. You can buy credits through the Platform by going to Account -> Wallet.

## How to redeem a coupon on Platform

If you have a coupon, you can redeem it for credits on Platform by following these steps.

<Note>
No Refunds for Pre-Redemption Payments: If you've already purchased additional credits before applying your coupon, CentML cannot issue a refund.

Non-Transferable Coupons: Once redeemed, coupons cannot be transferred to another account, nor can a new coupon be issued if applied to the wrong account. Ensure you're using the correct account before redeeming.
</Note>

1. <b>Log In to Your Account:</b> Sign in to the CentML Platform using the account you wish to redeem your coupon credits on.
2. <b>Go to Your Wallet:</b> From your <i>Account</i> page, select <i>Wallet</i>. Specify the number of credits you wish to redeem and click <i>Purchase</i>.

</Tip>
3. <b>Enter Your Coupon Code:</b> On the purchase page, type your coupon code in the <i>Add Promotion Code</i> field and click <i>Apply</i>.

## How to autoload credits on Platform

The <b>Autoload</b> feature ensures your CentML wallet is automatically topped up with credits when your balance drops below a set threshold. This helps maintain uninterrupted access to CentML Platform services.

<Note>
Autoreload operates independently of manual coupon redemptions. Coupons must still be applied manually via the Wallet.
</Note>

#### Setting up autoload

1. <b>Log In to Your Account:</b> Sign in to the CentML Platform using your account.
2. <b>Go to Your Wallet:</b> From your <i>Account</i> page, select <i>Wallet</i>.
3. <b>Add a payment method:</b>  If you do not already have a card on file, click <i>Add Card</i>
<Tip>
Ensure your saved payment method remains active and up-to-date. Failed payments may disable autoreload temporarily.
</Tip>
4. <b>Enable Autoload Threshold and Amount</b>: Click on the <i>Autoreload</i> checkbox below your payment information to enable autoload. Then, in the Autoload Details section, specify:
    - The amount to load (e.g. $10)
    - The minimum balance that should trigger the reload (e.g 100 credits)
    <Tip>Set a minimum balance high enough to avoid interruptions during active workloads.</Tip>
