The CentML platform operates on a credit-based billing system, where 1 CentML credit equals 1 USD. You can buy credits through the Platform by going to Account -> Wallet. Pricing details for both serverless and dedicated deployments can be found in the [console](https://app.centml.com).

**Serverless endpoint** usage is billed according to the total number of tokens generated and processed, while **dedicated deployments** are charged based on the duration of hardware usage, utilizing a per-minute billing system.
